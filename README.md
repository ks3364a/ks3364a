## **Projects**[^2]
  ### Machine Learning and Data Science
 -  Movie Genre Classification using FeedFroward NNs [Python, PyTorch, word2vec] &emsp;&emsp;    _In Progress_<br />
 -  Image Recognition using Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) [Python, PyTorch] &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  _In Progress_<br />
 - Hotel Review Classification [Python, Scikit-learn, Numpy, NLTK]<br />
    - Fully implement a probabilistic classifier and logistic regression model to classify 6000 hotel reviews as positive, 
      negative or neutral with 88% accuracy while dealing with live data and addressing text normalization and feature engineering.<br />
 - Generating Sentences using N-gram Language Model [Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib]<br />
    - Generated over 3500 sentences using Shannon‚Äôs method and measured performance of an out-of-domain test set by calculating its average probability, 
      standard deviation, and perplexity.<br />
  - Predicting Bird Strikes on Aircrafts [SQL, MySQL, R, and AWS]<br />
    - Collaborated with a team of 2 and determined which flightpath and aircraft are likely to hit by bird strike using different 
      statistical analysis such as Decision Trees and Logistic Regression.<br />
  -  Heart Disease Indicators [Python, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas]<br />
     - Built SVM, random forest and DNNs models with 100+ features to classify risk of heart disease in a person with 91% accuracy.
  ### Software
  - Health Data Tool Kit [Java, Spring Boot, CSS, and MySQL Server]<br />
    - Developed a full-stack web-application that processes 500,000+ records of daily personal activity data in JSON format, stores data in a remote SQL database.<br />
    - Built and thoroughly tested REST APIs to facilitate interaction between the database and application.<br />
  - Object Oriented Design: Blackjack Game [Java, Swing, JUnit]<br />
    - Applied model-view-controller architecture (MVC) and design patterns such as command for the controller, 
      observer for view, and strategy for the model to create a blackjack game with Swing GUI.<br />
    - Performed unit testing in JUnit with ~ 90% code coverage and documented the test scripts.<br />
